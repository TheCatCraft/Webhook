The build is compiled for an early version of the Microsoft Jazz architecture that predates the launch of the MIPS R4000 processor. As such, it actually targets the earlier R3000 processor, which is not fully compatible with the R4000. The build was used for an internal demonstration of Reversi running under Windows on Windows and x86 emulation on a MIPS machine during a weekly \"Thursday Beers\" event."

It supported dual booting with DOS, introduced a new API library to handle hardware instructions directly, and ran in protected mode (though setup used real mode). OS/2 1.0 leveraged 286 processor features such as segmented memory and multithreading but did not utilize 386 features like virtual 8086 mode or 32-bit applications."

It sold poorly in the consumer market but decently in corporate environments. Despite lacking a GUI, it allowed direct display access through the Vio library, later deprecated in 32-bit OS/2 versions. OS/2 1.1, released in 1988, added a proper GUI.",

Her reactor is not outputting steam as expected; instead, the steam builds up inside the system despite proper connections. The reactor previously overheated and required a rebuild. Jamie has tried following multiple YouTube guides and community advice, but the results remain inconsistent and misleading. She expressed a strong desire to remove the mod due to these persistent issues."

The reactor initially ran at around 213¬∞F with a burn rate of 10, which was later adjusted to 50 to stabilize at 263¬∞F. She uses a closed-loop system where cooled sodium returns from the boiler back into the reactor."

Bread noted that tube throughput is a limiting factor, while Serhan emphasized that even large setups could exceed tube capacities, making proper connection methods crucial. Superheated sodium should not be present in return pipes as it prevents the system from cooling efficiently."

Despite these efforts, the reactor system continued malfunctioning, leading to frustration and consideration to remove the mod entirely.
